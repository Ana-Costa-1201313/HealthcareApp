# Sprint Planning 

This sprint planning session was conducted on October 31, 2024, 11h-13h.

## Introduction
The team gathered to plan the upcoming sprint, referred to as Sprint B.

With guidance from the LAPR5 instructor, we concluded that it would be more effective to divide the four-week Sprint B into two shorter sprints of two weeks each. This division was intended to improve focus and allow for mid-sprint adjustments. The team collectively agreed to split Sprint B into Sprint B1 and Sprint B2, each spanning two weeks.

Following this decision, the team analyzed the user stories, aiming to understand the requirements for implementing each one. After extensive discussion and clarification, we worked to organize the user stories by their dependencies and estimated the time needed for each. Finally, we assigned each user story to a team member.


## Sprint Division
- Sprint B1: October 28, 2024 – November 10, 2024
- Sprint B2: November 11, 2024 – November 24, 2024

## User Story Analysis

The team dedicated considerable time to analyzing the user stories assigned for this sprint. The goal was to ensure that all members had a shared understanding of the requirements for each story. For each user story, we discussed our interpretations, moving on only once everyone agreed on its requirements. If we didn’t reach consensus immediately, we would continue discussions until we achieved alignment.

Despite our efforts to reach agreement internally, we identified some aspects that still required clarification from the client. This was especially true for stories where initial team interpretations differed. Asking the client for these clarifications was crucial for a comprehensive understanding of expectations.

## Dependencies

Once we analyzed each user story and reached a shared understanding, we organized the stories based on their dependencies. User stories with minimal dependencies were prioritized for early implementation, while those with more dependencies were scheduled for later. This approach aimed to reduce bottlenecks and enable continuous progress.

## Time Estimation

The team then proceeded to estimate the time required for each user story. For familiar user stories, we could make relatively accurate estimates. However, for stories where we lacked prior experience, we factored in additional time for learning and exploration to ensure a more realistic timeline.

## User Story Distribution

Not all user stories were assigned during the initial planning session. We decided it would be more efficient to distribute some of them later, allowing flexibility as the sprint progresses. This approach also accommodates variations in completion rates, as some team members may finish their assigned stories sooner than others. By waiting to assign certain stories, we can ensure a balanced workload and adjust assignments as needed based on individual progress and emerging sprint needs.
