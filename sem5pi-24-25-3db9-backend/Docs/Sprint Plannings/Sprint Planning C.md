# Sprint Planning 

This sprint planning session was conducted on November 26, 2024, 13h-16h.

## Introduction
The team gathered to plan the upcoming sprint, referred to as Sprint C.

With guidance from the LAPR5 instructor, we concluded that it would be more effective to divide the six-week Sprint C into three shorter sprints of two weeks each. This division was intended to improve focus and allow for mid-sprint adjustments. The team collectively agreed to split Sprint C into Sprint C1, sprint C2 and Sprint C3, each spanning two weeks.

Following this decision, the team analyzed the user stories, aiming to understand the requirements for implementing each one. After extensive discussion and clarification, we worked to organize the user stories by their dependencies and estimated the time needed for each. Finally, we assigned each user story to a team member.


## Sprint Division
- Sprint C1: November 25, 2024 – December 08, 2024
- Sprint C2: December 09, 2024 – December 22, 2024
- Sprint C3: December 23, 2024 – January 05, 2024

## User Story Analysis

The team dedicated considerable time to analyzing the user stories assigned for this sprint. The goal was to ensure that all members had a shared understanding of the requirements for each story. For each user story, we discussed our interpretations, moving on only once everyone agreed on its requirements. If we didn’t reach consensus immediately, we would continue discussions until we achieved alignment.

Despite our efforts to reach agreement internally, we identified some aspects that still required clarification from the client. This was especially true for stories where initial team interpretations differed. Asking the client for these clarifications was crucial for a comprehensive understanding of expectations.

## Dependencies

Once we analyzed each user story and reached a shared understanding, we organized the stories based on their dependencies. User stories with minimal dependencies were prioritized for early implementation, while those with more dependencies were scheduled for later. This approach aimed to reduce bottlenecks and enable continuous progress.

## Time Estimation

The team then proceeded to estimate the time required for each user story. For familiar user stories, we could make relatively accurate estimates. However, for stories where we lacked prior experience, we factored in additional time for learning and exploration to ensure a more realistic timeline.
